How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains every file that i added and that i want to commit. the working directory is the entire set of file which have already been committed and is the directory that i'm working on, it responds to the git status command. The repository is the folder for many directories (we can consider a set of potentially working directory that are mapped by commitID and that i can checkout with the git checkout command).
