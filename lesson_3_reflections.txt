When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When other people want to work at the same project. i might be not the only one person involved in the project, so other people have to be able to operate on it. A remote repository allows to keep a single repository synchronized online, and everyone can push and pull their own changes on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes commits aren't final commit of a feature so maybe it could be possible that the project doesn't run until the branch closes or a new final feature commit.
